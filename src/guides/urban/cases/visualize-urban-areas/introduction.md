In the next 20-30 minutes we will use satellite data to highlight urbanized areas in the region you have chosen. For this we will combine different bands of the satellite. Don't worry, it sounds more complicated than it is. We will guide you step-by-step through this process. And sure, at the end you will know what satellite bands are!

Don't worry, if you get stuck, just use our forum. We and other users are happy to help you.

Sounds good? Then go ahead...
