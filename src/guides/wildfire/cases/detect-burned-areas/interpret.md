**How to read the colors:** \
Yellow to green colored areas correspond to area that did not burn. Red areas indicate burned surface. BUT, there is an important fact to know: The NBR highlights burnt areas in large fire zones greater than 500 acres. You don’t get the burn severity. To observe burn severity, you have to subtract the post-fire NBR image from the pre-fire NBR image. That means, you need a NBR from a date before the fire and a NBR from a date after a fire. You want to do that? Cool, take a look to the links at the end of this section. You’ll find there a tutorial for that.

**Dive deeper into this topic:** \
You should never blindly rely on data. They know no context. That means the correct reading and interpretation of the data is up to you. Therefore, you should familiarize yourself with the NBR, its strengths and weaknesses, before publishing your findings or making decisions based on them.
