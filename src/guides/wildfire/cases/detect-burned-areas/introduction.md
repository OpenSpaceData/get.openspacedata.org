In the next 20-30 minutes we will burned areas on a satellite image showing the region you have chosen. For this we will use a scientific indicator - the Normalized Burn Ratio. Or NBR for short. Don't worry, it sounds more complicated than it is. We will guide you step-by-step through this process.

At the end you will get a picture where burned areas are colored red and healthy vegetation are colored green. This gives you a quick overview of burned areas and helps you to monitor changes in landscapes through fire hazards.

Don't worry, if you get stuck, just use our forum. We and other users are happy to help you.

Sounds good? Then go ahead...
