In the next 20-30 minutes we will detect snow on a satellite image showing the region you have chosen. For this we will use a scientific indicator - the Normalized Difference Snow Index. Or NDSI for short. Don't worry, it sounds more complicated than it is. We will guide you step-by-step through this process.

At the end you will get a picture where snow is white, surprise, and areas without snow are black. This gives you a quick overview of snow covered areas and helps you to monitor changes in snow covers.

Don't worry, if you get stuck, just use our forum. We and other users are happy to help you.

Sounds good? Then go ahead...
