In the next 20-30 minutes we will analyze the green vegetation on a satellite image showing the region you have chosen. For this we will use a scientific indicator - the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Or NDVI for short. Don't worry, it sounds more complicated than it is. We will guide you step-by-step through this process.

At the end you will get a picture where healthy vegetation is colored green and unhealthy vegetation, i.e. vegetation with low or no chlorophyll content, is colored orange or red. This gives you a quick overview of the state of the vegetation in your study area.

Don't worry, if you get stuck, just use our forum. We and other users are happy to help you.

Sounds good? Then go ahead...
