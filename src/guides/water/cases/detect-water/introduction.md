In the next 20-30 minutes we will analyze water bodies on a satellite image showing the region you have chosen. For this we will use a scientific indicator - the Normalized Difference Water Index. Or NDWI for short. Don't worry, it sounds more complicated than it is. We will guide you step-by-step through this process.

At the end you will get a picture where water bodies are colored vibrant blue and non-water content, i.e. soil, vegetation or buildings, are colored yellow to green. This gives you a quick overview of the water in your study area and helps you to monitor changes in water bodies.

Don't worry, if you get stuck, just use our forum. We and other users are happy to help you.

Sounds good? Then go ahead...
